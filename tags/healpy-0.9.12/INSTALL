Installation procedure for Healpy:
---------------------------------

* Note: Healpix is included, so you don't need to get it separately

The installation procedure is very simple:

> cd healpy-0.9.3.1
> python setup.py build

If everything goes fine, you can give a test:
> cd build/lib*
> ipython -pylab
>>> import healpy as H
>>> H.mollview(arange(12))

If the plot looks good, you can install:
> sudo python setup.py install  # install in default location, need root rights
or
> python setup.py install --install-lib=~/Softs/Python # will install healpy in directory ~/Softs/Python, which then must be in your PYTHONPATH

That's it !
