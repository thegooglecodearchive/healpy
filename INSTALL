Installation procedure for Healpy:
---------------------------------

* Note: Healpix is included, so you don't need to get it separately

Requirements:
* Healpix needs cfitsio. You can either:
 - use an existing installation :
   Define the environment variable CFITSIO_EXT_PREFIX where to find the
   cfitsio library and include file (eg /usr/local, so that
   /usr/local/include/fitsio.h and /usr/local/lib/libcfitsio.a exists),
   or define CFITSIO_EXT_INC (with the cfitsio include
   directory) and CFITSIO_EXT_LIB (with the cfitsio library file name)
 - compile a specific cfitsio lib:
   Define EXTERNAL_CFITSIO=no, place the  cfitsioXXXX.tar.gz in
   hpbeta/libcfitsio before installing. The cfitsio version XXXX must
   match the version in hpbeta/planck.make (or you need to modify it there).

The installation procedure is very simple:

$ cd healpy-0.9.3.1
$ python setup.py build

OR, if you do not want OpenMP support (sometimes, it causes SegFault)

$ python setup.py build --without-openmp

If you do not want the "-march=native" flag (if your g++ is too old)

$ python setup.py build --without-native

If everything goes fine, you can give a test:
$ cd build/lib*
$ ipython -pylab
>>> import healpy as H
>>> H.mollview(arange(12))
>>> pylab.show()

If the plot looks good, you can install:
$ sudo python setup.py install  # install in default location, need root rights
or
$ python setup.py install --install-lib=~/Softs/Python # will install healpy in directory ~/Softs/Python, which then must be in your PYTHONPATH
or
$ python setup.py install --user # will install it in your User python directory (python >= 2.6)

That's it !
